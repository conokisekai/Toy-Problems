# Toy Problems Challenge README

  

Welcome to the Toy Problems Challenge! In this challenge, you'll be tasked with solving three distinct problems related to student grading, speed detection, and net salary calculation. Each problem has its own unique requirements and objectives. Let's dive into the details of each challenge:

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator



Objective: Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

  

A > 79

B - 60 to 79

C - 59 to 49

D - 40 to 49

E - less than 40

  

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Objective: Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input, e.g., 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok." Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

  

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2."

If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended."

  

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Objective: Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

  

Important: Please use the values provided for KRA (Kenya Revenue Authority), NHIF, and NSSF as specified in the resource link provided.

  

For each of these challenges, make sure to create a separate code solution that fulfills the requirements. You can organize your code in a modular and readable manner to ensure clarity and maintainability. Additionally, consider incorporating user-friendly input prompts and clear output messages.

  

Feel free to document your code with comments or explanations to make it easy for others (or your future self) to understand how your solution works.

  

Good luck with the challenges, and happy coding! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
